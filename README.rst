Exploring Mandlebrot Plots
##########################

This is an imcomplete C++/GLUT project for exploring Mandlebrot plots. You need
to add a Complex number class to get this running. 

Clone this project for your own experimenting:

..  code-block:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/rblack42/Mandlebrot.git

Add your ``Complex.h`` header to the ``includes`` folder, and your
``Complex.cpp`` implementation file to ``lib``, then rdto this:

..  code-block:: shell

    $ make
    $ ./demo (on Linus/Mac)
    $ demo (on PC)
